# Security Threat Detection with Data Mining

## Introduction

Machine learning frameworks and libraries are used when applying data mining techniques for security threat detection. Let's use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in supervised machine learning in this example.
In this example, depending on our dataset and needs, we may need to explore different algorithms, perform hyperparameter tuning, and conduct more extensive preprocessing. Additionally, techniques such as clustering or anomaly detection algorithms can be used for unsupervised learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn

After please Replace your_dataset.csv with the actual path to your DARPA dataset CSV file.

Run the Python script:
python threat_detection.py
